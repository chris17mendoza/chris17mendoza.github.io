Hello, my name is Christopher Mendoza and I am a junior at CSUF.
I am a computer science major, but I also have many years of experience with art.

## Projects
### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a particular lab that stuck out to me, as it was the starting point in building my confidence in these assignments. This was also the first time we worked with 2 files instead of one, which I found exciting. We also learned `if` statements in part 2, which was really fun.

* Lab 7

    Despite being quite challenging at first, I found Lab 7 to be my favorite lab compared to the others. This lab helped me figure out how to condense code as much as possible while producing the desired output in the end, as shown in the `parking_functions.cc` file:

    ```C++
    bool CanParkOnDate(const std::string& day, int hour, int min) {
    if ((day != "sat" && day != "sun") &&
        ((hour == 6 && min >= 30) || (hour >= 7 && hour < 16))) {
      return false;
      }
    return true;
    }
   ```

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 introduced me to loops, which I have seen in prior coding experience with C#, but never really understood what they did up until this lab walked in. Many crazy and cool things can be done with loops. Many of the later labs also built on loops as well, to which I felt this was a great introduction to loops.
